Hi there, I'm Sed! 👋
I am an ICTS student currently based in Australia 🇦🇺. I am passionate about cybersecurity, cloud architecture, and the intersection of AI and automation. I use this space to share my projects and document my learning journey.

🛡️ What I'm Focused On
Cloud Security & Architecture (AWS): Designing secure, multi-tier cloud infrastructures. I specialize in building defense-in-depth models, such as isolating critical servers in private subnets without public IPs to minimize the attack surface. ☁️

Cybersecurity (Kali Linux): Exploring various offensive and defensive security tools to understand modern threat landscapes. 💻

Python & Security Tooling: Writing custom Python scripts to automate security tasks or modifying existing tools to fit specific lab scenarios. 🐍

AI & Automation: Building smart workflows using n8n and integrating AI to streamline security operations. 🤖
